# zz_FOD
This project is a part of a multi-modal template building approach, aiming to build a FOD template with all the intermediate transformations combined once in every iteration of registrations.  

## Functions
1. The script `build_nonlinear_fod_PBS` is the main template building function that calls functions and scripts in `utils` and `scripts` folders.  
2. The `apply_trans2fod.sh`, `apply_trans2mask.sh` and `trans2fod.sh` are the helper functions for the initiation of the template building process.  
3. This project also contains helper scripts for submitting jobs to PBS cluster.
